# Classification-of-Homer-or-Bart-using-NN
bout Dataset
Context
As a big Simpsons fan, I have watched a lot (and still watching) of The Simpson episodes -multiple times each- over the years. I wanted to build a neural network which can recognize characters. I chose from the two most likeable characters Bart and Homer.

Content
This is an image dataset: 2 folders (one for each character) with 196-73 pictures from training and test.

Acknowledgements
Data is directly taken and labeled from TV show episodes.

Inspiration
So that the community and I can test your machine learning and deep learning skills with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
